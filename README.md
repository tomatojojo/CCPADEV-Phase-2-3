# J3
A web application for music distribution and sharing for various artists.

## Description
This website serves as our group’s final project for the course CCAPDEV. It makes use of the various languages we have learned throughout the course such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Jquery, as well as technologies such as Heroku and MongoDB Atlas. The web application is a music distribution and sharing website wherein users can create their own account and upload their music that other users may view and listen to. The users may make their own account and by doing so, they are able to upload and update their own songs, as well as view, download and like the songs of other artists.
